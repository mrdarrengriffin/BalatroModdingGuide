title: Does Balatro allow mods?
---

<div style="font-size: 1.25rem">Yes! ðŸŽ‰</div>

Although there is no native support for mods within Balatro, [Steammodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods) exists to bring mod support. Since the game is built using [LÃ–VE 2d](https://love2d.org/), mods are possible thanks to the [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) injector. 

An "injector" is something that hooks into the LÃ–VE 2d game during runtime which allows modular patching of the game. Steammoodded then uses Lovely to provide mod support for Balatro

## Will Balatro ever get native mod support?
Likely not. localthunk shared his thoughts on adding a native mod interface in Discord:
> I wonâ€™t be adding any kind of modding interface
>
> The closest I might do is some kind of folder to drag and drop mods into [...]
>
> But a modding interface/api wonâ€™t go nearly far enough for the modding community

## Will Balatro ever implement features from mods?
No. localthunk recognises that the modding community flourishes but keeps his distance as to not affect his creative input into the game. 

> I try to avoid looking at any Balatro mods so that I can remain as fresh as possible as a designer. I love designing this game and I don't want to take/be accused of stealing any other designs. My favourite part of Balatro development is coming up with these ideas myself!
